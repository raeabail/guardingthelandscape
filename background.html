          Camp Atterbury, established in <b>1942</b> on 40,000 acres of farms and small communities in <b>Johnson, Bartholomew, and Brown Counties</b>, has long served as a training hub for the
          <b>Indiana National Guard and numerous other military personnel from multiple branches</b>. While the installation preserved large interior blocks of land from private development,
          the surrounding counties have steadily transformed. Farmland giving way to suburban sprawl in Johnson County, moderate growth along the I-65 and US Highway 31 corridors in Bartholomew,
          and low-density rural development in Brown County. These shifts shape the challenges of today: <b>balancing military readiness, ecological conservation, and community resilience</b> in the face of accelerating land use change and extreme weather.
          <br><br>
          To explore these challenges, the following sections present in-depth analyses of three interconnected themes: <b>encroachment through incompatible land use, priority species, and extreme weather</b>. These analyses span historical patterns, current conditions, and future trajectories, with an optional executive summary provided for quick reference.</p>

                <p>
                  Large interior training areas within Camp Atterbury have remained relatively protected from private development,
                  while land use patterns in the surrounding counties have shifted steadily over time. Johnson County has experienced
                  increasing suburban expansion, Bartholomew County has seen growth concentrated along the I-65 and U.S. Highway 31
                  corridors, and Brown County has transitioned toward lower-density rural development. Together, these changes reduce
                  landscape connectivity, increase fragmentation at the installation boundary, and elevate the potential for land use
                  conflicts near training areas. As development continues outward, maintaining compatible land uses around the installation
                  becomes increasingly complex.

                <p class="why">
                  <strong>Why this matters for Camp Atterbury:</strong>
                  Encroachment at the boundary can constrain training flexibility, increase long-term management challenges, and limit opportunities
                  to preserve compatible landscapes around the installation.

                <p>
                  Camp Atterbury supports large, intact blocks of forest, wetlands, and connected natural areas that provide important habitat
                  for priority species. Outside the installation, land use change has altered habitat availability and connectivity in different ways
                  across Johnson, Bartholomew, and Brown Counties. Suburban expansion, transportation infrastructure, and dispersed rural development
                  introduce fragmentation that can isolate populations and reduce long-term habitat viability. As a result, areas of high ecological value
                  do not always align with existing protected lands or current management boundaries.
                </p>

                <p class="why">
                  <strong>Why this matters for Camp Atterbury:</strong>
                  Sustaining priority species depends on conservation strategies that extend beyond the installation boundary and account for how surrounding
                  land use patterns influence habitat persistence and connectivity.

                <p>
                  Across Camp Atterbury and the surrounding counties, extreme weather events, particularly heavy rainfall and prolonged heat, are occurring in ways
                  that directly affect training areas, access routes, and nearby communities. Intense rainfall can limit site access, increase flooding in low-lying
                  training zones, and strain drainage systems influenced by surrounding land use patterns. Extended heat events place added stress on personnel,
                  ecosystems, and infrastructure, amplifying operational challenges. Together, these pressures illustrate how extreme weather, interacting with ongoing
                  land use change, shapes readiness and long-term resilience across the landscape.

                <p class="why">
                  <strong>Why this matters for Camp Atterbury:</strong>
                  Extreme weather can disrupt training schedules, damage infrastructure, and increase recovery time, making proactive planning essential for sustained readiness.
