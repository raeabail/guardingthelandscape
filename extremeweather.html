    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Intensifying rainfall, stronger wind events, and expanding floodplains are reshaping how both the installation 
        and surrounding communities prepare for and recover from storms. What were once routine seasonal floods 
        now bring higher runoff, faster flows, and growing pressure on local infrastructure and training lands.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Across <strong>Johnson, Brown, and Bartholomew Counties</strong>, development has replaced forests and farmland 
        with hard surfaces that accelerate water movement and magnify damage. As weather extremes collide with expanding 
        urban footprints, the region faces a new reality: resilience depends on understanding how water, wind, and land use 
        interact across boundaries. This page traces that story from historic baselines to projected future risks.

          <h3>Pre-1980s: A Naturally Buffered Watershed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Flooding was largely confined to natural river systems, primarilythe East Fork White River and Salt Creek tributaries surrounding Camp Atterbury.</li>
            <li>Rural farmland and forest cover dominated the watershed, allowing rainfall to infiltrate soils, recharge groundwater, and slow surface runoff.</li>
            <li>Natural flood buffering reduced storm impacts, with wetlands, riparian corridors, and undeveloped floodplains absorbing excess water during heavy precipitation events.</li>
            <li>Military training areas were rarely affected by major storms, with minimal infrastructure at risk.</li>
            <li>Historic flood documentation from the U.S. Geological Survey shows that even during extreme precipitation events, flood impacts were concentrated along established river corridors rather than across the broader landscape as shown in the map to the right. </li>

          <ul>
            <li>Storm intensity and seasonal rainfall variability increased, with more frequent high-intensity precipitation events, producing sharper runoff peaks.</li>
            <li>Although total annual rainfall changed modestly, shifts in storm timing and intensity placed increasing stress on local drainage networks with higher peak storm events becoming more common.</li>
            <li>Rapid suburban and exurban growth in Johnson and Bartholomew Counties transformed large areas of farmland and forest into residential subdivisions, commercial corridors, and transportation infrastructure, replacing permeable soils with subdivisions and paved surfaces.</li>
            <li>As illustrated in the map to the left, upstream development increased runoff efficiency, routing rainfall more quickly toward Camp Atterbury’s lowlands and contributing to higher average monthly discharge and flooding conflicts with training operations.</li>
            <li>By the late 2000s, these shifting extreme weather patterns and land-use changes were no longer abstract trends, but conditions under which extreme weather events could directly affect installation operations.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Mapped FEMA floodplain boundaries expanded along the East Fork White River, extending closer to, and in some areas directly adjacent to, Camp Atterbury’s perimeter, reflecting increased flood exposure under contemporary hydrologic conditions.</li>
            <li>Localized flash floodings increasingly affected training access roads and riparian zones corridors, and low-lying areas within the installation buffer area, disrupting site access and limiting the usability of flood-prone training zones during and after major storm events.</li>
            <li>Regional stormwater systems were increasingly tested by high-intensity rainfall and interacting with expanded impervious surface runoff, resulting in faster runoff delivery, higher peak flows, and reduced system capacity during extreme precipitation events.</li>

          <h3>2020s: Managing Extreme Weather in Real Time</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>Camp Atterbury’s perimeter now lies at the convergence of several extreme weather stressors, including mapped floodplains, concentrated stormwater runoff pathways, and corridors exposed to high winds and storm activity.</li>
            <li>Frequent heavy rainfall events disrupt training schedules and limit vehicle access, particularly in low-lying roads and riparian corridors, while also amplifying flash flood risk during short-duration, high-intensity storms.</li>
            <li>Severe convective storms, including tornado-producing systems, introduce short-notice operational disruptions, such as high winds, debris hazards, power outages, and safety restrictions that affect both training and administrative functions.</li>

          <h3>2050 & Beyond: Intensifying Extreme Weather Risk</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Projections for southern Indiana consistently indicate wetter conditions by mid-century, with annual precipitation increases on the order of approximately 15-25% and a disproportionate rise in heavy precipitation events that intensify runoff generation and stormwater loading across the region.</li>
            <li>More frequent and intense storm events are expected to increase peak flows, flash flooding, and backwater effects, particularly along the East Fork White River and connected tributaries, potentially extending flood exposure into Camp Atterbury’s southern training ranges and low-lying operational areas.</li>
            <li>Future extreme weather risk is expected to be compounded by continued land use change, as ongoing suburban and exurban development increases impervious surface coverage and reduces landscape infiltration capacity in upstream and adjacent watersheds.</li>
            <li>Severe convective storms, including high wind and tornado-producing systems, are projected to remain a persistent regional hazard, sustaining short-notice risks to infrastructure, power systems, access routes, and training continuity.</li>

  <!-- 2008 Columbus Flood -->
  <div class="case-study">
    <button class="case-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="caseColumbus2008">
      2008 Columbus Flood Event
    </button>
    <div id="caseColumbus2008" class="case-content">
      <p>
        On June 7, 2008, between <strong>5 and 11 inches of rain</strong> fell across southern Indiana in less than 24 hours.
        The East Fork White River overtopped its levees, inundating large portions of <strong>Columbus, Indiana</strong>.
        Nearly <strong>3,000 homes were damaged</strong>, and almost <strong>1,000 residents evacuated</strong> as floodwaters spread far beyond mapped floodplains.
      </p>

      <p>
        The flood marked one of the most damaging weather events in Bartholomew County history. <strong>Columbus Regional Hospital</strong>—the city’s
        primary healthcare center—was forced to evacuate 157 patients after 13 feet of water filled its basement, shutting the facility down for four months.
        The <strong>Cummins Technical Center</strong> also sustained major losses, halting engine testing for weeks and forcing operations to relocate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Entire residential blocks, such as those on <strong>Pleasant Grove in downtown Columbus</strong>, were permanently cleared after the flood.
        The area has since been redeveloped into open greenspace, including a <strong>butterfly habitat and flood-compatible parkland</strong>—a deliberate shift
        toward resilient land use in vulnerable lowlands.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the decade that followed, the city implemented major structural and policy changes:
        <ul>
          <li>Construction of <strong>flood walls and hydraulic gates</strong> around key facilities like Columbus Regional Hospital.</li>
          <li>Installation of <strong>early-warning river gauges and mobile alert systems</strong> to improve emergency response.</li>
          <li>Expanded FEMA <strong>buyout and green infrastructure programs</strong> to reduce exposure in high-risk neighborhoods.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The 2008 flood permanently reshaped Columbus’s land-use strategy—transforming
        developed floodplain zones into ecological buffers and emergency management corridors. The city now designs
        around flood recurrence, not just recovery.

      2015 Brown County Flash Flood
    </button>
    <div id="caseBrown2015" class="case-content">
      <p>
        In mid-July 2015, a series of intense thunderstorms swept through <strong>Brown County</strong>, dropping several inches of rain in a matter of hours.
        <strong>Flash flooding struck steep, shallow-soil terrain</strong> near Bean Blossom and Salt Creek, where upland runoff funneled rapidly into narrow valleys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Residents recalled the speed and force of the event—water rose to window height within minutes. 
        Streams such as <strong>Gnaw Bone Creek</strong> overflowed after debris blockages redirected flows toward nearby homes.
        Dozens of properties were flooded, including homes restored after the 2008 event. One fatality occurred as floodwaters
        swept across low-lying rural roads.
      </p>

      <p>
        The flood disrupted <strong>electrical service for over 2,000 residents</strong>, caused widespread road closures, and left
        businesses along State Road 46 coated in mud. Relief efforts were coordinated by the Brown County YMCA and
        Emergency Management, which distributed supplies and organized temporary shelter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Hydrologic lessons</strong> from this event underscored the risks of <strong>upland flash floods</strong>—occurring outside mapped FEMA flood zones where
        steep topography and poor soil infiltration magnify storm impacts. The county has since incorporated <strong>LiDAR-based watershed mapping</strong>
        and <strong>stream debris maintenance programs</strong> to identify and mitigate similar vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The 2015 Brown County flood highlighted the intersection of climate, terrain, and infrastructure—showing how 
        short-duration, high-intensity storms can devastate small communities even beyond traditional floodplains.

  <!-- IMPLICATIONS -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="accent-heading">What the Data Reveal</h2>
      <div class="impact-grid">

    <div class="impact-box">
      <h4>Compound Exposure Across Boundaries</h4>
      <p>
        Data across the <strong>Camp Atterbury landscape</strong> reveal that extreme precipitation, flooding, and severe wind events 
        are intensifying in both frequency and magnitude. Floodplain expansion along the <strong>East Fork White River</strong> and 
        surrounding tributaries now overlaps with areas of rapid residential and commercial growth in <strong>Johnson</strong> and 
        <strong>Brown Counties</strong>. As storm intensity increases, the combination of higher runoff and concentrated 
        development is reshaping Atterbury’s exposure profile and straining shared drainage systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="impact-box">
      <h4>Encroachment and Impervious Growth</h4>
      <p>
        Mapping floodplains alongside <strong>building footprints</strong> and <strong>impervious surface change</strong> highlights where 
        encroachment into natural drainage corridors is amplifying flood and stormwater risks. Development north and east of the 
        installation, particularly near <strong>Franklin</strong> and <strong>Columbus</strong>, has accelerated runoff toward Atterbury’s 
        low-lying perimeter, reducing infiltration and increasing pressure on infrastructure and training areas. 
        Similar trends are observed in <strong>Camp Ripley</strong>, where conversion of forest and wetland cover has altered local 
        hydrology and sedimentation patterns, underscoring the regional scale of this challenge.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="impact-box">
      <h4>Resilience and Adaptive Capacity</h4>
      <p>
        Integrating <strong>climate projection datasets</strong> into the analysis indicates that storm frequency and rainfall intensity 
        are likely to rise through mid-century, expanding both community and mission risks. For Camp Atterbury, adaptation will depend 
        on strengthening <strong>natural buffers</strong>, retrofitting stormwater infrastructure, and prioritizing 
        <strong>flood-compatible land use</strong> within surrounding jurisdictions. Together with Camp Ripley’s ongoing resilience 
        planning, these findings demonstrate how coordinated, landscape-scale strategies can sustain readiness while reducing 
        vulnerability to extreme weather.

    <div class="case-modal-title-bar"></div>

    <p><strong>Event:</strong> Two tornadoes struck Camp Atterbury within minutes of each other during a severe storm system in June 2008.</p>
<br>
    <p><strong>Impacts:</strong> The tornadoes caused extensive damage to administrative buildings, vehicles, power lines, and other installation infrastructure. 
      More than <strong>50 buildings were damaged</strong>, and critical services—including <strong>electricity and gas</strong>—were temporarily disrupted.</p>
 <br>
    <p><strong>Operational Response:</strong> No injuries occurred among the more than <strong>3,500 personnel</strong> on the installation due to advance weather monitoring,
      routine tornado drills, and rapid implementation of safety protocols. Training operations resumed within hours.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrates direct exposure of military installations to severe convective storms and tornado hazards.</li>
      <li>Highlights operational vulnerability of administrative and support infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Underscores the importance of preparedness, redundancy, and rapid recovery capacity.</li>
