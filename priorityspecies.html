    <p>
      While Camp Atterbury offers a refuge of intact forest, nearby land conversion and suburban expansion threaten federally protected species 
      like the <b>Indiana bat</b> and <b>Northern long-eared bat</b>. This section explores the patterns of habitat loss and fragmentation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Using <b>habitat suitability, roost buffer analysis, and land use overlays</b>, we highlight areas where biological significance and regulatory 
      pressure are converging. Reducing suitable habitat on private lands around Atterbury has and will place more pressure on the remaining available 
      habitat on the installation. Additionally, as suitable habitat is lost outside the fence, opportunities for private lands conservation measures to protect 
      bat habitat are also reduced. These conservation measures that could be implemented over the next few years can reduce long term regulatory burdens of 
      the installation to meet the needs of these priority species.

          <h3>Pre-1940s: A Patchwork Landscape Before Camp Atterbury</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Before Camp Atterbury was established, the area was mostly a patchwork of small farms, pastures, and scattered woodlots in Johnson, Bartholomew, and Brown counties, just north of the more forested southern Indiana.</li>
            <li>Indiana and Northern long-eared bats roamed widely across southern Indiana, using riparian forests, oak–hickory stands, and upland hardwoods for roosting and foraging.</li>
            <li>Local caves in southern Indiana provided key winter hibernation sites, with bats moving seasonally between these underground sites and surrounding summer forests.</li>
            <li>Brown County and future Camp Atterbury lands contained expansive tracts of forest and bottomland habitat.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1940s–1960s: Installation & Initial Preservation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Camp Atterbury was established in 1942, transforming agricultural lands into military training space but forest cores were preserved inside the new installation boundary.</li>
            <li>Because Atterbury preserved large forest blocks within its boundary, upland and riparian roost habitats remained largely intact within and adjacent to the installation.</li>
            <li>From the 1940s through the 1960s, development on the installation was concentrated in cantonment, road, and range infrastructure, so much of the interior forest and riparian habitat stayed relatively intact.</li>
            <li>As a result, conditions remained suitable for Indiana bat and Northern long-eared bat roosting and foraging in and around Camp Atterbury.</li>

          <h3>1967–1990s: Listing Era & Conservation Emergence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Indiana bats were listed as endangered in 1967, and in 1983, a federal recovery plan emphasized protecting hibernacula and maintaining, protecting, and restoring maternity roosts and forested areas across the species’ range, including the Camp Atterbury–Brown County area.</li>
            <li>Northern long-eared bats were historically common in many Midwestern forest bat surveys.</li>
            <li>Late 1990s surveys at Camp Atterbury documented Indiana bat maternity colonies (as shown in the map to the left), identified primary roost trees, and confirmed foraging activity along Nineveh Creek, Driftwood River, and ponds near the multi-impact training range.</li>
            <li>Habitat fragmentation increased around Johnson and Bartholomew Counties due to increasing suburban and transportation development, but Brown County retained over 90% forest cover, maintaining a large core of habitat.</li>

          <h3>2000s–2010s: Suburban Expansion Meets Habitat Decline</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Rapid suburban growth in Johnson County converted forest blocks into housing, retail, and road infrastructure, reducing available bat habitat.</li>
            <li>New subdivisions and highway-oriented development along US-31 and I-65 corridors increased light and noise pollution, which increasingly overlapped with bat habitat loss</li>
            <li>Both Indiana and Northern long-eared bats faced rising habitat fragmentation near Franklin, Whiteland, and Edinburgh, with roost patches becoming smaller and more isolated from each other and from cave hibernacula.</li>
            <li>Additionally, following the arrival of white-nose syndrome in Indiana in 2011, monitoring of both bat species documented steep regional declines.</li>

          <h3>2015–2020s: Dual Listings, Increased Pressure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The Northern long-eared bat was federally listed as threatened in 2015, and then they were reclassified as endangered in 2023 as populations continued to decline.</li>
            <li>ESA compliance risk around Camp Atterbury increased sharply as more development (transportation, utility, and residential) increasingly overlapped with bat habitat.</li>
            <li>Ongoing subdivision expansion and associated infrastructure removed potential roost trees, narrowed forested corridors, and further fragmented habitat north and east of the installation.</li>
            <li>Habitat integrity remained strongest in Brown County, but growing rural parcelization began threatening long-term continuity.</li>

          <h3>2040–2050: What the Future Holds</h3>

            <li>Projections indicate continued stress on Indiana and northern long-eared bats from disease, habitat loss, and changing environmental conditions that may alter where high-quality summer habitat persists.</li>
            <li>Ongoing forest fragmentation and intensified development may isolate colonies, especially near I-65 and expanding suburban corridors, especially where riparian and upland woods narrow or are further subdivided.</li>
            <li>Camp Atterbury’s role as a habitat anchor is likely to grow, potentially limiting training flexibility unless the Indiana National Guard systematically evaluates endangered species impacts and identifies appropriate mitigation approaches (avoidance, minimization, and off-site compensation, i.e., replacing or providing substitute habitat).</li>
            <li>Proactive actions like reforestation, conservation easements, and light/noise buffers could strongly influence future ESA compliance obligations and the long-term persistence of bat populations in the region.</li>

  <h3>Impervious Surface Hotspots & Bat Habitat Conflicts</h3>

  <div class="narrative">
    <p>
      For nearly a century, the forests in and around Camp Atterbury have supported have provided roosting and foraging habitat for the federally endangered Indiana bat. 
      Yet over time, this landscape has transformed from abandoned farm fields in the early and mids 1900s back into forest, initially improving habitat. 
      Now, that trend is reversing with forest habitat loss and fragmentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand where pressures are most acute, the interactive map below integrates impervious surface change with bat habitat buffers and zoomed-in hotspot windows. 
      Together, these views illustrate how the same forests that sustain the species are increasingly intersecting with human growth and land conversion.

      As development expands north and east of Camp Atterbury, key forest corridors that support Indiana bat habitat are narrowing. Insets reveal the places where these pressures are most rapidly converging.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      These hotspots, particularly <b>Franklin/Whitland, Edinburgh and I-65, and Trafalgar</b>, show where forest corridors have thinned, where upland and riparian 
      roosting areas face increasing pressure, and where future ESA compliance risks are likely to intensify. As impervious surfaces expand, the continuity of habitat 
      needed for foraging and maternity roost connectivity becomes more constrained, heightening the importance of conservation strategies within and around Camp Atterbury.

  <h3>Atterbury’s Ecological Network</h3>
  <div class="narrative">
    <p>
      The habitats that sustain the Indiana and Northern long-eared bats also support a broader network of declining species that rely on Indiana’s remaining forests, 
      streams, and transitional edge habitats. These species not only reflect the health of the ecosystem but also help guide restoration and management priorities across 
      the landscape.
    </p>

    <p>
      The four species highlighted below represent a cross-section of Atterbury’s ecological story—from forest canopies to streambeds—each facing distinct pressures from 
      land conversion, climate stress, and habitat fragmentation. Together, they illustrate how protecting one species often benefits many.

    <h4>Pressures on a Changing Landscape</h4>
    <p>
      What emerges is a story of contrast. Brown County remains one of the last strongholds of intact forest—its dense canopy still 
      supporting maternity roosts and seasonal foraging routes. To the north and east, however, the landscape tells a different story: 
      housing growth in Johnson and Bartholomew Counties has fragmented corridors, reduced mature roost trees, and intensified 
      compliance pressures under the Endangered Species Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, projections suggest that suitable roosting conditions may shift northward by mid-century. 
      Without proactive restoration, conservation easements, and habitat buffers, these pressures will only deepen—tightening 
      the overlap between military readiness and ecological resilience.
