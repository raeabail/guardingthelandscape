      <p>
          Camp Atterbury’s protected interior has remained largely intact since 1942, but the landscape at its edges tells a different story. 
          Over eight decades, rural farmland and forests have gradually transformed into a suburban frontier, where homes, roads, and industrial 
          corridors now press against training lands and wildlife habitat.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          This section combines two lenses, <b>encroachment</b> and <b>incompatible land use</b>, to trace how changing development patterns are reshaping the region, and 
          what those trends mean for <b> military readiness, ecological integrity, and community resilience</b>.

            Encroachment refers to the gradual expansion of residential and commercial growth toward military installations. Around Camp Atterbury, this takes the form 
            of surburban sprawl along the Greenwood-Franklin-Edinburgh corridor, annexations near Columbis, and amenity-driven rural housing in Brown County's forests.
          </p>
        <br>
          <p>
            Encroachment itself is <b><u>not</u> inherently negative</b>, but when new development intersects sensitive areas such as bat habitat, floodplains, and recharge zones, 
            it becomes an <b>incompatible land use</b> challenge.

            Incompatible land use occurs when development patterns or infrastructure undermine training capability, enviornmental quality, or public safety. This includes
            new homes or schools near live-fire or flight zones, as well as residential and commericial development into floodplains or areas known to support sensitive 
            species such as bat habitat.

  <h2 class="accent-heading">Encroachment Risk</h2>
    <p>
      Development pressure around Camp Atterbury’s perimeter does not occur evenly. 
      The <strong>north and northeast</strong> experience the strongest encroachment risk driven by 
      suburban growth. The <strong>east and southeast</strong> show moderate expansion linked to 
      corridor-based development, while the <strong>west and southwest</strong> remain comparatively 
      stable due to steep, forested terrain that slows residential subdivision activity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Understanding this pattern requires examining how surrounding landscapes have changed over time. 
      The <strong>EVA (Enhanced Visualization and Analysis)</strong> tool, built from MRLC’s national 
      land cover dataset, reveals how development has evolved from <strong>1985–2024</strong> across 
      <strong>Brown, Johnson, and Bartholomew Counties</strong>—the three counties that most strongly 
      shape encroachment patterns around Camp Atterbury.

  <h2 class="accent-heading">Growth in Numbers, Patterns of Change</h2>
       <p>
      The EVA findings help illustrate <strong>where</strong> development pressure is occurring, but long-term demographic and land-use trends explain <strong>why</strong> those pressures have emerged. Over the last several decades, population growth, septic density increases, and land conversion have steadily reshaped the region surrounding Camp Atterbury.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As the counties north and northeast of the installation urbanized, development expanded 
      <strong>south from Indianapolis</strong> in Johnson County, 
      <strong>outward from Columbus</strong> in Bartholomew County, 
      and into the <strong>amenity-driven uplands</strong> of Brown County. 
      These trajectories mirror the EVA development patterns shown above and reveal how encroachment pressure has gradually intensified along specific borders of the installation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In rural, unsewered areas, especially Brown County, clusters of <strong>new septic permits</strong> provide some of the earliest signals of forest fragmentation and low-density subdivision growth. These changes often appear years before satellite-based land-cover updates, making septic trends a valuable early indicator of emerging encroachment corridors.

        Taken together, these long-term growth and development trajectories and early indicators (such as septic permit

        <h3>Looking Toward 2050</h3>
        <p>
          Camp Atterbury’s landscape will continue evolving. The question is not whether growth will occur, but 
          how well it will coexist with the missions and habitats that define this place. Through data-driven 
          mapping, historic land records, and forward-thinking policy, Indiana can build a future where growth 
          and stewardship align rather than collide.

    <h2>Chase Point Development – SR-46 Corridor</h2>
    <div class="case-modal-title-bar"></div>

    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Northeast corner of SR-46 & County Road 500 W in West Columbus, Bartholomew County.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Proposal:</strong> The city is considering annexing and rezoning about <b>107 acres of farmland</b> at SR-46 and County Road 500 W from 
      <b>Agriculture: Preferred (AP) to Residential (RS-4 and RM).</b> The proposed “Chase Point” project would include about <b>250 single-family homes and a multi-family 
      section planned for later phases</b>, transforming what is currently working farmland and wooded open space into suburban residential development.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Converts productive agricultural land and wooded open space</b> along a flood-prone corridor into suburban housing.</li>
      <li><b>Replaces one of the last farmland buffers</b> between Columbus’s west side and the Tipton Lakes area, pushing the suburban edge northward toward Camp Atterbury.</li>
      <li><b>Reflects Indiana’s broader trend of farmland-to-housing conversion</b>, requiring new infrastructure and traffic improvements along SR-46 and CR-500 W.</li>
      <li><b>Introduces development within mapped floodplain and flood-fringe zones</b>, increasing future flood-management costs and ecological disturbance.</li>
      <li><b>Embodies the “corridor-edge farmland” conversion pattern</b> identified by <i>AFT’s Farms Under Threat 2040</i>, where annexations fill in formerly agricultural transition zones. </li>
    </ul>

      <h3>From Forested Valleys to Lakefront Living</h3>
      <p>
        While encroachment today often conjures images of suburban sprawl and highway corridors, the forces reshaping Indiana’s landscapes began long before modern suburbs. 
        The creation of <b>Cordry and Sweetwater Lakes</b> offers an early example of how land conversion, much like the trends revealed in our land cover and population data, 
        can permanently redefine <i>buffers</i>, <i>ownership</i>, and <i>ecological connectivity</i> around key areas of the state.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>A Tale of Development, Debt, and a Drawn Fenceline</h3>
      <p>
        The Cordry–Sweetwater Lakes development began in the 1950s during a boom in private lake construction across southern Indiana. <b>Developer Howard Prince</b>, 
        known for creating Prince’s Lakes, envisioned twin reservoirs joined by a canal to maximize lakefront property. But financial troubles led to bankruptcy, receivership, 
        and the formation of a new governing body.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>The Conservancy Takes Shape</h3>
      <p>
        In 1961, the <b>Cordry–Sweetwater Conservancy District (CSCD)</b> was established by court order to complete the dams and manage utilities for the lakeside community. 
        Both dams were finished by the late 1960s, <i>Sweetwater in 1967</i> and <i>Cordry in 1968</i>, though the connecting canal was never built due to rising costs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>The “Fenceline” and Private Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        CSCD owns all roads, parks, and the lakes themselves, which are reserved for lot owners and their guests. Property lines stop at the “fenceline”, marking the 
        boundary between private land and conservancy-owned lakebed—once dry ground that became submerged when the dams filled. Lot owners have lake privileges, but not 
        lake ownership.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>Relevance to Encroachment and Compatibility</h3>
      <p>
        The Cordry–Sweetwater Lakes represent an early form of encroachment, rooted not in urban expansion but in <b>lifestyle-driven transformation</b>. By converting 
        forested valleys into private, recreational property, the development blurred the line between natural and built environments.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Its legacy underscores how <b>cultural values, land speculation, and evolving ownership models</b> have long shaped Indiana’s landscapes. This transformation 
        foreshadowed the development pressures now visible around Camp Atterbury, where property demand and limited planning coordination continue to drive fragmentation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Cordry–Sweetwater’s story is both a historical lesson and a cautionary example: even well-intentioned projects can alter watershed function, access, and habitat 
        connectivity for generations.
