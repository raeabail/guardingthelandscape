      <p>
          Camp Atterbury’s protected interior has remained largely intact since 1942, but the landscape at its edges tells a different story. 
          Over eight decades, rural farmland and forests have gradually transformed into a suburban frontier, where homes, roads, and industrial 
          corridors now press against training lands and wildlife habitat.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          This section combines two lenses, <b>encroachment</b> and <b>incompatible land use</b>, to trace how changing development patterns are reshaping the region, and 
          what those trends mean for <b> military readiness, ecological integrity, and community resilience</b>.
      </p>

    <p style="margin: 40px auto 20px; text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
      Before diving into the data, it helps to clarify what these terms mean in practice and why they matter for both defense and conservation.

            According to the <b>Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) program</b>, encroachment is any external factor that inhibits military readiness, including 
            but not limited to the growing competition for <b>land, airspace, waterfront access, and frequency spectrum</b>. 
          </p>
        <br>
          <p>
            Incompatible land uses can impact critical, at-risk military mission capabilities at different scales over time. Increasingly, land uses far away from the installation 
            and range boundaries can also have an impact on the military's ability to train, test, and operate.
          </p>
        <br>
          <p>
            Around Camp Atterbury, encroachment takes the form of suburban sprawl along the Greenwood-Franklin-Edinburgh corridor, annexations near Columbus, and amenity-driven 
            rural housing in Brown County's forests. Encroachment itself is <b><u>not</u> inherently negative</b>, but when new development intersects sensitive areas such as bat 
            habitat, floodplains, and recharge zones, it becomes an <b>incompatible land use</b> challenge.

          <p>
            Incompatible land use occurs when development patterns or infrastructure undermine training capability, environmental quality, or public safety. This includes
            new homes or schools near live-fire or flight zones, as well as residential and commercial development into floodplains or areas known to support sensitive 
            species such as bat habitat.
          </p>
        <br>
          <p><strong>Per REPI, development near military areas can restrict training, testing, and operating in many ways, including:</strong></p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><b>Night-vision training disruption:</b> Lights from residential and commercial development reduce the effectiveness of night-vision training</li>
            <li><b>Noise complaints:</b> Complaints about noise, dust, and smoke generated by military activities result in restrictions on the timing, frequency, and type of training activities</li>
            <li><b>Frequency spectrum competition:</b> Competition for frequency spectrum interferes with mission readiness</li>
            <li><b>Infrastructure conflicts:</b> Communication towers, wind turbines, highways, and energy transmission lines near or through training areas all hinder realistic training and testing</li>
            <li><b>Habitat displacement:</b> Land development that destroys or fragments endangered species habitat pushes those species onto less developed military lands, resulting in increased restrictions on training and testing land</li>

  <h2 class="accent-heading">Encroachment Risk</h2>
    <p>
      Development pressure around Camp Atterbury’s perimeter does not and has not occurred evenly. 
      The <strong>north and northeast</strong> experience the strongest encroachment risk driven by 
      suburban growth. The <strong>east and southeast</strong> show moderate expansion linked to 
      corridor-based development, while the <strong>west and southwest</strong> remain comparatively 
      stable due to steep, forested terrain that slows residential subdivision activity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Understanding this pattern requires examining how surrounding landscapes have changed over time. 
      The <strong>EVA (Enhanced Visualization and Analysis)</strong> tool, built from Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) 
      Consortium’s national land cover dataset, reveals how development has evolved from <strong>1985–2024</strong> across 
      <strong>Brown, Johnson, and Bartholomew Counties</strong>, the three counties that most strongly 
      shape encroachment patterns around Camp Atterbury.

  <h2 class="accent-heading">Growth in Numbers, Signals of Change</h2>
       <p>
      The EVA findings illustrate <strong>where</strong> development pressure is occurring, but long-term demographic and land-use trends help explain <strong>why</strong> those pressures have emerged. 
      Over the last several decades, population growth, increasing septic density, and gradual land conversion have steadily reshaped the landscape surrounding Camp Atterbury.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As counties north and northeast of the installation urbanized, development expanded 
      <strong>south from Indianapolis</strong> in Johnson County, 
      <strong>outward from Columbus</strong> in Bartholomew County, 
      and into the <strong>amenity-driven uplands</strong> of Brown County. 
      
      These trajectories mirror the EVA development patterns shown above and reveal how encroachment pressure has intensified along specific borders of the installation over time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In rural, unsewered areas, especially Brown County, <strong>new septic permits</strong> provide some of the earliest signals of forest fragmentation and low-density subdivision growth. 
      Because this form of development often preserves forest canopy, it can remain largely invisible in satellite-based land-cover datasets.
      Septic permit density clustering therefore offers a valuable early indicator of emerging encroachment corridors, frequently appearing years before land-cover change is detectable.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The interactive map below visualizes septic permit locations and timing across Brown County from 1960 to present, allowing you to see these patterns unfold across the landscape.</p>

      The spatial legacy of decades of permit activity remains visible across Brown County's landscape, with concentrations in amenity-driven uplands and along forest edges.

          The readiness and habitat pressures described above become most acute where development patterns directly overlap 
          with Camp Atterbury's operational buffers and critical ecological features. Drawing from the EVA analysis, 
          demographic trends, and field observations, three distinct conflict zones emerge, each shaped by different 
          development drivers, and each presenting unique compatibility challenges.

          Camp Atterbury’s landscape will continue evolving. The question is not whether growth will occur, but 
          how well it will coexist with the missions and habitats that define this place. Through data-driven 
          mapping, historic land records, and forward-thinking policy, Indiana can build a future where growth 
          and stewardship align rather than collide.

    <h2>Chase Point Development – SR-46 Corridor</h2>
    <div class="case-modal-title-bar"></div>

    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Northeast corner of SR-46 & County Road 500 W in West Columbus, Bartholomew County.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Proposal:</strong> The city is considering annexing and rezoning about <b>107 acres of farmland</b> at SR-46 and County Road 500 W from 
      <b>Agriculture: Preferred (AP) to Residential (RS-4 and RM).</b> The proposed “Chase Point” project would include about <b>250 single-family homes and a multi-family 
      section planned for later phases</b>, transforming what is currently working farmland and wooded open space into suburban residential development.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Converts productive agricultural land and wooded open space</b> along a flood-prone corridor into suburban housing.</li>
      <li><b>Replaces one of the last farmland buffers</b> between Columbus’s west side and the Tipton Lakes area, pushing the suburban edge northward toward Camp Atterbury.</li>
      <li><b>Reflects Indiana’s broader trend of farmland-to-housing conversion</b>, requiring new infrastructure and traffic improvements along SR-46 and CR-500 W.</li>
      <li><b>Introduces development within mapped floodplain and flood-fringe zones</b>, increasing future flood-management costs and ecological disturbance.</li>
      <li><b>Embodies the “corridor-edge farmland” conversion pattern</b> identified by <i>AFT’s Farms Under Threat 2040</i>, where annexations fill in formerly agricultural transition zones. </li>

      <h3>From Forested Valleys to Lakefront Living</h3>
      <p>
        While encroachment today often conjures images of suburban sprawl and highway corridors, the forces reshaping Indiana’s landscapes began long before modern suburbs. 
        The creation of <b>Cordry and Sweetwater Lakes</b> offers an early example of how land conversion, much like the trends revealed in our land cover and population data, 
        can permanently redefine <i>buffers</i>, <i>ownership</i>, and <i>ecological connectivity</i> around key areas of the state.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>A Tale of Development, Debt, and a Drawn Fenceline</h3>
      <p>
        The Cordry–Sweetwater Lakes development began in the 1950s during a boom in private lake construction across southern Indiana. <b>Developer Howard Prince</b>, 
        known for creating Prince’s Lakes, envisioned twin reservoirs joined by a canal to maximize lakefront property. But financial troubles led to bankruptcy, receivership, 
        and the formation of a new governing body.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>The Conservancy Takes Shape</h3>
      <p>
        In 1961, the <b>Cordry–Sweetwater Conservancy District (CSCD)</b> was established by court order to complete the dams and manage utilities for the lakeside community. 
        Both dams were finished by the late 1960s, <i>Sweetwater in 1967</i> and <i>Cordry in 1968</i>, though the connecting canal was never built due to rising costs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>The “Fenceline” and Private Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        CSCD owns all roads, parks, and the lakes themselves, which are reserved for lot owners and their guests. Property lines stop at the “fenceline”, marking the 
        boundary between private land and conservancy-owned lakebed, once dry ground that became submerged when the dams filled. Lot owners have lake privileges, but not 
        lake ownership.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-slide">
      <h3>Relevance to Encroachment and Compatibility</h3>
      <p>
        The Cordry–Sweetwater Lakes represent an early form of encroachment, rooted not in urban expansion but in <b>lifestyle-driven transformation</b>. By converting 
        forested valleys into private, recreational property, the development blurred the line between natural and built environments.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Its legacy underscores how <b>cultural values, land speculation, and evolving ownership models</b> have long shaped Indiana’s landscapes. This transformation 
        foreshadowed the development pressures now visible around Camp Atterbury, where property demand and limited planning coordination continue to drive fragmentation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Cordry–Sweetwater’s story is both a historical lesson and a cautionary example: even well-intentioned projects can alter watershed function, access, and habitat 
        connectivity for generations.
